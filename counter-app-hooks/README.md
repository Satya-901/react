## Overview

Welcome to the Counter App! This is a simple application built using React that allows users to increment and decrement a counter with the click of buttons. The app includes validation to ensure that the counter cannot exceed 20 or go below 0.

## Features

1. **Increment Counter**: Users can click the "Add" button to increase the counter value by 1.
2. **Decrement Counter**: Users can click the "Remove" button to decrease the counter value by 1.
3. **Limitations**: The counter cannot exceed 20, and it cannot go below 0. These limitations are enforced to maintain the integrity of the application.
4. **Visual Feedback**: The interface provides clear visual feedback to indicate the current counter value and whether the limitations are being approached or reached.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The app is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The logic for the counter functionality is written in modern JavaScript.
- **CSS**: Basic styling is applied using CSS to enhance the user interface.
